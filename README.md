I've decided that I want to be a better advocate for FOSS so:

I'll be on Codeberg with [mfjurbala](https://codeberg.org/mfjurbala) but keep GitHub for collaboration with projects and people here too.

I'm also swithcing to Mastodon with [@mfjurbala@mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online/@mfjurbala) but still might ocassionally use Twitter.

I am sometimes on Element under [@mfjurbala:matrix.org](https://element.io/).
