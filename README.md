I think leaving Github will hinder contributing to existing FOSS projects and reduce potential networking. So, I'm back. I'm still on Codeberg with [mfjurbala](https://codeberg.org/mfjurbala) but may not put anything significant there for the time being.

I also use both Mastodon with [@mfjurbala@mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online/@mfjurbala) and twitter with [@mfjurbala](https://twitter.com/mfjurbala). I'm not a huge user of social media though.

I am sometimes on Element under [@mfjurbala:matrix.org](https://element.io/).
